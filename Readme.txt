Project Description and Metadata Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------

While choosing the meta data for this book I wanted to pick pieces that conveyed important information about each page and things that were not directly represented on colenda but were present in the meta data. Thats why I chose to include the description and pick the key data points which identified each page and the writing on it. Additionally I Included key points that help relate each page/file to the overarching book and document so that it kept its overall unity despite being separated into each individual page. That included the page and overall sequence numbers as they kept the order together and helped preserve the narrative that was told through each successive treaty and meeting between the Chiefs and other representatives. Lastly, I included blanket metadata like language and year of publication in order to give readers a context of the data and the book overall.

Cleaning and Extracting Text Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------


A big problem I had with my text was that since it was such an old publication there were quite literally typos in the original source with certain letter being mixed up such as the letter f and s as seen on the first page with the word supply where it is written as 'fupply.' Overall OCR was able to capture the text fairly accurately minus some of the names which I will touch on after. But ocr just flat out copied these typos as is. That was why I decided to run the extraction again through AI tools like Anthropic so that it could correct these original typos and have coherent writing. Both made similar mistakes on writing out the names but anthropic was very good at predicting the word based of the context and was able to correct instances like 'fupply' into 'supply.' Overall a combination of the 2 tools worked very accurately. The only common mistake I kept noticing as I mentioned before is that both the AI and OCR could not accurate transcribe the names of the chiefs and other key Native American figures. I think this is just a lack of data on Anthropic and lack of pattern recognition on OCR which I found made many more mistakes than Anthropic overall. I cannot speak to the accuracy of tables and graphs as my book had none but overall anthropic's transcriptions seemed much more accurate and helpful than OCR, although the OCR program was much more straight forward and efficient at the task.
