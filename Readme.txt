Project Description and Metadata Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------

While choosing the meta data for this book I wanted to pick pieces that conveyed important information about each page and things that were not directly represented on colenda but were present in the meta data. Thats why I chose to include the description and pick the key data points which identified each page and the writing on it. Additionally I Included key points that help relate each page/file to the overarching book and document so that it kept its overall unity despite being separated into each individual page. That included the page and overall sequence numbers as they kept the order together and helped preserve the narrative that was told through each successive treaty and meeting between the Chiefs and other representatives. Lastly, I included blanket metadata like language and year of publication in order to give readers a context of the data and the book overall.
