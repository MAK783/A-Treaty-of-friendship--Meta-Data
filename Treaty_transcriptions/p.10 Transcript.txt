Present also

The MAYOR and Recorder of the City,

With divers Gentlemen, and a very large Audience that filled the House
and its Galleries.

The Indian Chiefs being come and seated,

The President, before proceeding to hear them, thought proper to inform
the Audience, that in August 1732, a great Treaty having been held in
this Place with several Chiefs of the Six Nations, they had made report
thereof on their Return to their Great Council, where the several Propositions
that had been made to them on the Part of this Government, had been
fully considered; and that these Chiefs now present, of whom there never
at any time before had been so great a Number met in this Province, were
now come to return their Answer.

The Indians being made acquainted with what the President had said,
were told, that we were ready to hear them.

Whereupon Kanickhungo their Speaker, addressing himself to their Brother ONAS (which signifies PENN) to their Brother JAMES LOGAN, and the Gentlemen of the Council, spoke as follows by Conrad Wyler the Interpreter;

BRETHREN,

WE are now come down from the Towns of our several Nations,
to give our Answer to the great Treaty, which we and you
held together, at this Place, about four Years since: This Answer has been agreed and concluded upon by our great Council,
who have carefully considered all that passed between you and us, and expressed their great Satisfaction in the friendly and good Dispositions of
you our Brethren, towards all the Indians of the Six Nations; and as you
received us kindly, and at that Treaty undertook to provide and keep
for us a Fire in this great City, we are now come to warm ourselves
thereat, and we desire and hope it will ever continue bright and burning
to the End of the World.

Hereupon he laid down a large Belt of white Wampum of eleven Rows, with
four black St. George's Crosses in it, and proceeding, said

BRETHREN,

SOON after our Brother ONAS, who is now here, came into
this Country, he and we treated together; he opened and cleared the
Road between this Place and our Nations, which was very much to our
good Liking, and it gave us great Pleasure. We now desire that this Road,
for the mutual Accommodation and Conveniency of you and us who
Travel therein to see each other, may be kept clear and open, free from
all stops or Incumbrances; and if, since the time that we last cleared it
with you, any Tree has fallen across it, or if it is any way stopped up, of
which however we know nothing, we are now willing to open and clear
the same from every Interruption; and it is our hearty Desire that it
may so continue, while the Earth endureth.

Hereupon he presented a Bundle of Skins in the Hair, and went on;

BRETHREN,
