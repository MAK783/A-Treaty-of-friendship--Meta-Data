The President representing to the Board the Necessity of dispatching the Indians of the Six Nations, who being very numerous remain here at a great Charge, proposed that the Consideration of the Value of the Present to be given them, should be now proceeded upon; and accordingly the Board entering upon the same, and observing that for these many Years there has not been so great an Appearance here of Chiefs of their Nations as at this time, and that they have returned very full and distinct Answers to every Article of the Treaty with them in 1732, are of Opinion, that proper Goods for them to the Value of about Two Hundred Pounds, should be provided and given them; and that to Conrad Weyfer, the Interpreter, who is extremely useful on all such Occasions, and on the present one has been very serviceable, there be given Twenty Pounds.

At a Council held at Philadelphia, October 12. 1736:

The President informed the Board, that agreeable to the Minute of the 4th, Care had been taken to provide Goods for the Indians: But next Day, after Council, consulting with Conrad Weyfer, the Interpreter, he had advised that the Delivery of the Present should be delayed till the Indians had finished with the Proprietary, with whom they were then to treat about the Purchase of Lands; that most of last Week being spent therein, the Indians had Yesterday ended with the Proprietary, having signed Releases to him for all the Lands lying between the Mouth of Sascachannah, and Kekachtainius Hills, and that it now remained to conclude on the Quantity and Quality of the several Goods to be given them, and on the Substance of what should be proper to be spoke to them; The Board are of Opinion, that considering the large Quantity of Goods which they have had from the Proprietor on the Purchase, it may not at this time be necessary to give them, in Behalf of this Government, so great a Present as the Value ordered by the aforesaid Minutes; but that it may very well be considerably reduced; and accordingly, it is Ordered, that it be reduced to between Sixty and Seventy Pounds.

The President likewise acquainting the Board, that the Indians, at a Meeting with the Proprietor and him, had taken Notice that Conrad Weyfer, and Shekallamy, were by the Treaty of 1732, appointed as fit and proper Persons to go between the Six Nations, and this Government, and to be employed in all Transactions with one another, whose Bodies the Indians said were to be equally divided between them and us, we to have one half, and they, the other; that they had found Conrad faithful and honest, that he is a true good Man, and had spoke their Words, and our Words, and not his own; and the Indians having presented him with a Draft Skin to make him Shoes, and two Deer Skins, to keep him warm, they said, as they had thus taken Care of our Friend, they must recommend their's (Shekallamy) to our Notice; and the Board judging it necessary that a parti-
