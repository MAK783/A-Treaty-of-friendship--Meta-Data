That they were now to speak to the Proprietor and our People for the last time this Visit; that we had spoke to them last night, and recapitulated the Heads of all that had been agreed between them and us, as the Fire, the Path, the Chain; that we are now become one People; with every other Article that had been mentioned between us: This they will remember on their Parts through all Generations, and they desire that we may remember the same as long as the Earth endures.

That having now brightened the Chain, and confirmed all the Articles necessary for establishing perfect Friendship between them and us, and being thus become one People, they must desire that we would be more reasonable in the Sale of our Goods, which are much dearer (they say) from our Traders than from those of New-York; that the Powder sold by the Traders of New-York, is generally found to be mixed with black Duff, so that the Bullet falls often short of the Mark through the Badness of the Powder; that if we would sell cheap, we might thereby draw a great Trade to this Province, far beyond that of any others, which would be to our Advantage.

That if Civility at Conestogoe, should attempt to make a Sale of any Lands to us or any of our Neighbours, they must let us know, that he hath no Power to do so; and if he does any thing of the kind, they the Indians will utterly disown him.

That last night we told them the Woods were very dark, and that it was impossible to prevent Rum being carried to Allegheny; that if the Case be thus, we had better hinder any Persons from going thither at all, and confine our Traders to the River Sasquehannah and its Branches; for as several Indian Warriors pass by Allegheny, where so much Rum is constantly to be had, they cannot but be very apprehensive that some Mischief may happen; this Consideration often troubles them.

In Answer to all which, the Indians were thus told by the Interpreter.
