“ It has been agreed between us, that we should suffer no Injury to be done to one of your People more than to our own, nor without punishing the Offender in the same manner as if it had been done to one of our People ; and you all engaged on your parts that you would give us the like Satisfaction for every Injury done by your People to any of ours, and whatever should happen of this kind, it should make no other Difference, than as if the Injury were done by one English or White Man to another, and so in the Case of an Indian. Now since you came here, we have heard that a White Man one of our People, and one of yours, being both in Liquor, quarrelled at Allegheny, that the Indian struck at the White Man with a Knife, and the White Man gave the Indian some Blows on the Head, of which he died in four or five Days after; that the White Man got out of the way, and hid, and when he heard the Man was dead, he ran away to the Southward of Virginia : Who was first in the Fault in this matter we know not, but we have now issued a Proclamation for apprehending the White Man, and proposed a Reward of Ten Pounds, to any one who will seize and deliver him to some Magistrate or Officer, that he may be put in Prison and tried for his Life; if then it appears that he willfully kill the Man, he will be hanged by our Law; if it was in Defence of his own Life, he is not to die for it, but after he is tried we shall acquaint you how the matter appeared. The first Account we had of it was in a Letter, which the Interpreter shall read and acquaint you with it; but that Story being told only on one side, we do not depend on it for the Truth ; and thus we shall act in all such Cases, as Brethren always ought whenever they unfortunately happen.

“ We are very sensible Rum is the principal occasion of the Disorders, and we heartily wish any means could be possibly found to prevent the Abuse of it: You have desired us in your Discourse with the Proprietor to recall all our Traders from Ohio or Allegheny and the Branches of Sasquehannah ; We desired at our Treaty four Years ago that all our Indians, the Delaware, Shawonese, and others, should be recalled from Ohio, for we knew not then but there might be War with the French, and you know the Strength of a People consists in their being drawn close together as into one Body, and not to be scattered ; but we know not what you mean by recalling our Traders; for you are sensible the Indians cannot live without being supplied with our Goods: They must have Powder and Lead to hunt, and Cloaths to keep them warm; and if our People do not carry them, others will, from Maryland, Virginia, Jersey, or other Places; and we are sure you do not desire that Indians should trade with other People rather than with ours. The Traders of all Nations find the Indians are so universally fond of Rum, that they will not deal without it: We have made many Laws against carrying it; we have ordered the Indians to have the Casks of all that is brought amongst them; but the Woods have not Streets like Philadelphia, the Paths in them are endless, and they cannot be stopped; so that it will be carried either from one Country or another; and on the other hand the Indians are so very fond of the Liquor, even the best of them, that instead of taking it from the whole they drink it, and having it, they take and drink it, which is both unjust in itself, and does more Mischief; for the Traders, if they kept
