All of us here, and all you see of any Credit in the Place, can every Day have as much Rum of their own to drink as they please, and yet scarce one of us will take a Dram, at least not one Man will on any Account be drunk, no not if he were hired to it with great Sums of Money.

“ And now to bind and confirm all these our Words, we have provided for you the following Goods, which will be delivered to you to morrow at the President's Lodgings, to wit.

*One Hundred Pounds of Powder,*  
*One Hundred & Fifty Pounds of Lead,*  
*Twelve Strowed Matchcoats,*  
*Twelve Kettles,*  
*Twelve Blankets,*  
*Twelve Duffels,*  
*With some Tobacco, Pipes, Rum, and Sugar.*

*Twenty five Hatchets,*  
*One Hundred Knives,*  
*Thirty one Yards and \( \frac{1}{2} \) of half Thicks,*  
*Two Hundred Flints,*  
*One dozen Looking-Glasses,*  
*Three dozen Scissars.*
